Creating a distribution file on Windows
If you are running on Windows, open a command prompt in the folder that
contains your three files, vsearch.py, setup.py, README.txt,  then enter this command:
say:
    C:\Users\Head First\mymodules> py -3 setup.py sdist
The Python interpreter goes to work immediately after you issue this
command. A large number of messages appear on screen (which we show
here in an abridged form):

 running sdist
 running egg_info
 creating vsearch.egg-info
 ...
 creating dist
 creating 'dist\vsearch-1.0.zip' and adding 'vsearch-1.0' to it
 adding 'vsearch-1.0\PKG-INFO'
 adding 'vsearch-1.0\README.txt'
 ...
 adding 'vsearch-1.0\vsearch.egg-info\top_level.txt'
 removing 'vsearch-1.0' (and everything under it)

When the Windows command prompt reappears, your three files have
been combined into a single distribution file. This is an installable file
that contains the source code for your module and, in this case, is called
vsearch-1.0.zip.
 You’ll find your newly created ZIP file in a folder called dist, which has also
been created by setuptools under the folder you are working in.

Distribution Files on UNIX-like OSes
 code reuse
 If you are not working on Windows, you can create a distribution file in much
the same way as on the previous page. With the three files (setup.py,
README.txt, and vsearch.py) in a folder, issue this command at your
operating system’s command line:

  mymodules$ python3 setup.py sdist

Like on Windows, this command produces a slew of messages on screen:
 running sdist
 running egg_info
 creating vsearch.egg-info
 ...
 running check
 creating vsearch-1.0
 creating vsearch-1.0/vsearch.egg-info
 ...
 creating dist
 Creating tar archive
 removing 'vsearch-1.0’ (and everything under it)

When your operating system’s command line reappears, your three files have
been combined into a source distribution file.
This is an installable file that contains the source code for your
module and, in this case, is called vsearch-1.0.tar.gz.
 You’ll find your newly created archive file in a folder called dist, which
has also been created by setuptools under the folder you are working in
(which is mymodules in our case)

*********************************************************************************

Installation of the distribution file (Windows)

Locate your newly created ZIP file under the dist folder (recall that the file is
called vsearch-1.0.zip). While in the Windows Explorer, hold down the Shift
key, then right-click your mouse to bring up a context-sensitive menu. Select Open
command window here from this menu. A new Windows command prompt opens. At this
command prompt, type this line to complete the Step:

 C:\Users\...\dist> py -3 -m pip install vsearch-1.0.zip

If this command fails with a permissions error, you may need to restart the command
prompt as the Windows administrator, then try again.

When the above command succeeds, the following messages appear on screen:

 Processing c:\users\...\dist\vsearch-1.0.zip
 Installing collected packages: vsearch
 Running setup.py install for vsearch
 Successfully installed vsearch-1.0

******************************************************************************

  .../dist$ sudo python3 -m pip install vsearch-1.0.tar.gz

When the above command succeeds, the following messages appear on screen:

 Processing ./vsearch-1.0.tar.gz
 Installing collected packages: vsearch
 Running setup.py install for vsearch
 Successfully installed vsearch-1.0

The vsearch module is now installed as part of site-packages.
